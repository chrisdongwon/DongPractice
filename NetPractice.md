# Level 1
- Concepts
	- IP (Internet Protocol) address
		- Intuition: identification label on the network
		- 32 bits for IPv4 (128 bits for IPv6)
		- 4 octets (0 to $2^8 - 1 = 255$) separated by dots
		- Decimals are human readable, but all operations rely on binary representation
		- Usually modifiable
	- MAC (Media Access Control) is an identification for networking hardware
		- Usually unmodifiable
	- Subnet mask
		- Intuition: designates which part of the IP address corresponds to the network and the host
		- In binary representation, 1 corresponds to the network and 0 corresponds to the host
	- Network prefix:
		- Performing bitwise AND on the binary representations of the IP address and the subnet mask results in the network address.
		- If the host bits are all 0, then the resulting address is the **network address** and thus cannot be used as the host address (ambiguous)
		- Host bits with all 1 are reserved for **broadcast address** and cannot be used as the host address. 
	- Host suffix:
		- Obtained by performing bitwise AND with the IP address and _one's complement (flipping 1's and 0's)_ of the subnet mask.
- Solution
	- **Hosts can communicate if and only if the network prefixes match.**
	- Furthermore, check that each decimal integer (usually in the host suffix) is an octet (0 - 255). If not, just assign some random value between 1 and 254.
# Level 2
- Concepts
	- /n means first $n^{th}$ bits in the subnet mask are 1
	- Masks must have nonnegative trailing 0s
		- Possible octet -dec(imal values for subnet masks:
			- 1111 1111: 255 (/32)
			- 1111 1110: 254 (/31)
			- 1111 1100: 252 (/30)
			- 1111 1000: 248 (/29)
			- 1111 0000: 240 (/28)
			- 1110 0000: 224 (/27)
			- 1100 0000: 192 (/26)
			- 1000 0000: 128 (/25)
			- 0000 0000: 0 (/24)
- Solution
	- Goal 1:
		- To simplify the matter, use the same subnet mask but change the IP of A1 to match the network prefix.
			- Possible values for the 4th IP address value is from 193 to 222, because 222 AND 224 = 192.
				- Do NOT use 192, since it will have trailing 0's and it refers to the network address, and by similar reasoning, 223 (all 1's) will be for broadcast address.
			- **To simplify, just use a value differing by 1 (as long as it is within range).**
	- Goal 2:
		- Similar to above, subnet mask ending with 252 means only the last 2 bits can be used for assigning host values. 0,1,2,3 are the possible host values but 0 is reserved for network address and 3 is reserved for broadcast address, **so only 1 and 2 are the possible ending values for the IP addresses with this subnet mask.**
		- Special addresses
			- 127.x.x.x is reserved for **loop back** (for sending data packets to itself) and therefore is not a valid address for a host.
			- 0.x.x.x means *unknown address*
				- Not assignable
			- 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 is the *multicast range*
				- Not valid for hosts
				- **First octet greater than 223 is invalid.**
		- **For a simple solution, 126 or 128 instead of 127 should be sufficient.**
# Level 3
- Concepts
	- Having a *network switch* simply allows for more hosts to communicate, not just a 2-way communication like the previous levels
		- IP addresses and subnet masks still abide by the same rule
		- In reality, switches are responsible for communicating via MAC
			- Analogy: MAC = ZIP Code
- Solution
	- It simplifies the problem to have the same subnet mask for all hosts
		- Since 255.255.255.128 is the fixed subnet mask for C, use that for A and B as well
	- Assigning host suffixes with unique values between 1 to 126 should work.
# Level 4
- Concepts
	- Routers allow for different subnets to communicate
		- Each interface associated with the router must be a different subnet
			- Therefore, different subnet masks
		- **The subnet mask defines the possible subnet partitions, and the host bits of the router interface’s IP determine which partition the interface belongs to
			- hosts must have IP addresses within that same partition to connect through it.
		- Host ranges **cannot** overlap - the partitions must be disjointed, otherwise the host assignment to a router is ambiguous
		- Tip: range sizes can be figured out by subtracting the value from 256
		- In reality, routers are responsible for communicating via IP
			- Analogy: IP = Building Address
- Solution
	- R2 and R3 have fixed IP addresses and subnet masks:
		- R2 has 128 as the last mask value - partitions are by 128 bits.
			- With IP ending with 1, the usable host range is from 1 to 126
		- R3 has 192 as the last mask value - partitions are by 64 bits.
			- With IP ending with 244, the usable host range is from 193 to 254
		- The host range partitions must be disjointed
			- For R1, 129 to 190 appear to be the usable host values
				- This implies that the maximum partition size is 64, therefore the subnet mask should be /26
			- Last value of the IP address also should be in this range to validate the partition
				- For simplicity, choose 129
	- A1 has a fixed IP address ending with 132
		- Given a subnet mask of /26, this means R1 is the router A1 can connect to
	- B1 has variable IP and mask
		- For simplicity, also use /26 as the subnet mask and connect to R3 since it also has the same mask, and also connect to R1
# Level 5
- Concepts
	- Host machines can have multiple network interfaces
	- A host interface connects the host to a specific network, and host routing tells the host where to send traffic that is not destined for any directly connected network, automatically selecting the interface that can reach that gateway.
		- **Hosts need routing because the destination IP is outside their own subnet, as defined by their mask.**
		- Unless a specific routing is required, using "default" is the simplest solution for host routing
			- default = 0.0.0.0/0
	- **Hosts in different subnets can communicate by routing each host traffic to a router interface that is in its own subnet.**
- Solution
	- R1 has fixed IP: 51.21.182.126 and mask: 255.255.255.128
		- Possible hosts: 51.21.182.x, where x is from 1 to 126
	- R2 has fixed IP: 130.251.50.254 and mask: 255.255.192.0
		- Possible hosts: 130.251.x.y, where x is from 0 to 63 and y is from 1 to 254
	- A1 should have the same mask as R1 and a usable host number
		- Suggestion: 51.21.182.1 /25
	- B1 should have the same mask as R2 and a usable host number
		- Suggestion: 130.251.0.1 /18
	- Host routing:
		- A: default to IP of R1 (51.21.182.126)
		- B: default tot IP of R2 (130.251.50.254)
# Level 6
- Concepts
- Solution
	- R1 has a fixed subnet mask of /25
		- Also use subnet mask of /25 for A1
	- A1 has a fixed IP of 28.155.218.227
		- IP for R1 should be 28.155.218.x, where the range of x is determined by the last octet of the subnet mask for R1
			- With /25, I can have two partitions
				- Use the subnet with 129-254 host numbers to be compatible with A1
