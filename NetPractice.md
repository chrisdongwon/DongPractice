# Level 1
- Concepts
	- IP (Internet Protocol) address
		- Intuition: identification label on the network
		- 32 bits for IPv4 (128 bits for IPv6)
		- 4 octets (0 to 2^8 - 1) separated by dots
		- Decimals are human readable, but all operations rely on binary representation
	- Subnet mask
		- Intuition: designates which part of the IP address corresponds to the network and the host
		- In binary representation, 1 corresponds to the network and 0 corresponds to the host
	- Network prefix:
		- Performing bitwise AND on the binary representations of the IP address and the subnet mask results in the network address.
		- If the host bits are all 0, then the resulting address is the **network address** and thus cannot be used as the host address (ambiguous)
		- Host bits with all 1 are reserved for **broadcast address** and cannot be used as the host address. 
	- Host suffix:
		- Obtained by performing bitwise AND with the IP address and _one's complement (flipping 1's and 0's)_ of the subnet mask.
- Solution
	- **Hosts can communicate if and only if the network prefixes match.**
	- Furthermore, check that each decimal integer (usually in the host suffix) is an octet (0 - 255). If not, just assign some random value between 1 and 254.
# Level 2
- Concepts
	- /n means first $n^{th}$ bits in the subnet mask are 1
	- Masks must have nonnegative trailing 0s
		- Possible octet -decimal values for subnet masks:
			- 1111 1111: 255
			- 1111 1110: 254
			- 1111 1100: 252
			- 1111 1000: 248
			- 1111 0000: 240
			- 1110 0000: 224
			- 1100 0000: 192
			- 1000 0000: 128
			- 0000 0000: 0
- Solution
	- Goal 1:
		- To simplify the matter, use the same subnet mask but change the IP of A1 to match the network prefix.
			- Possible values for the 4th IP address value is from 193 to 222, because 222 AND 224 = 192. Do NOT use 192, since it will have trailing 0's and it refers to the network address, and by similar reasoning, 223 will be for broadcast address.
			- **To simplify, just use a value differing by 1 (as long as it is within range).**
	- Goal 2:
		- Similar to above, subnet mask ending with 252 means only the last 2 bits can be used for assigning host values. 0,1,2,3 are the possible host values but 0 is reserved for network address and 3 is reserved for broadcast address, so only 1 and 2 are the possible ending values for the IP addresses with this subnet mask.
		- 127.x.x.x is reserved for **loop back** (for sending data packets to itself) and therefore is not a valid address for a host.
			- Workaround - 126 or 128 should work just fine.
